# Non-Contact-Thermometer
This project has been prepared to meet the need for non-contact temperature measurement, which has come to the fore due to the Covid-19 epidemic. Temperature is measured with the MLX90614 gy-906 sensor and displayed on the 0.96" I2C OLED screen. Arduino Nano is used as the processor.
